Programatically-Add-Posts
=========================

This functionality has been pulled directly from ParentTheme core code. This repository exists in order to allow for the following presentation. The presentation will be given at the Nashville WPDev breakfast and 2014 WordCamp St Louis.

### Title
How to programmatically add posts to the wp database

### Detailed description
There are a few default ways to add posts to the wpdb, but most methods are fairly limited. WordPress has a function that can do this with relative ease. With the proper implementation you can have a class that you can use for importing content into your site, adding data from a csv file or adding data from an api. Once you're able to programmatically add posts to the wpdb WordPress as a cms can expand into WordPress as an application.

### Brief paragraph about yourself
I am a NorthWest boy at heart, but live in Nashville and love it. I've been helping cultivate the Nashville WordPress community since 2010 and am currently on the planning teams for both the Nashville Meetup and WordCamp.
